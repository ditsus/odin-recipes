    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prepare this classic chicken salad recipe in just 15 minutes with only a few simple ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: I most often use rotisserie chicken, but leftover chicken of almost any kind, including grilled chicken, can be used. If using canned chicken, mix all ingredients except the chicken in a bowl and then gently fold in the drained canned chicken.</li>
        <li>Add-ins: Since this is a classic chicken salad recipe, I add celery for crunch and green onion for flavor.</li>
        <li>Dressing: Mayonnaise adds a creamy texture, while simple seasonings add flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop cooked and cooled chicken and place into a large bowl with celery and onions.</li>
        <li>Mix dressing ingredients (recipe below) in a bowl. Toss with chicken.</li>
        <li>Serve on rolls, bread, or over a bed of lettuce.</li>
    </ol>
